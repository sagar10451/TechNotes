## Study Resources

I completed the **Stephane Maarek AWS SAA-C03 course on Udemy**, which I highly recommend:

[AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/106WtA3@Pq3jAoaAYkSb9YRG29VE7fOHXCfjhWMHj_VYho_lcllNDkkW20e7JoSdyU0h8AO_Cw==/)

## Exam Experience

The course coverage was excellent - there was **only 1 question** that was outside the scope of what Stephane taught. The rest of the exam was well-covered by the course material.

## My Study Notes

I've compiled comprehensive notes covering all the topics you need to know for the exam. You can find them in this repository.

## Study Tips

1. **Create your own notes** - This helps with retention and understanding
2. **Practice questions** - I have not practiced more than 30 questions, I had confidence that I would be able to crack it. I just went through 20 sample questions given by AWS to practice once you schedule exam.

**Good luck with your certification journey!** 

Happy Learning!
